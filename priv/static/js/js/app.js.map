the connection.\n// Connect to the server using the `Socket` class:\n//\n//     let socket = new Socket(\"/ws\", {params: {userToken: \"123\"}})\n//     socket.connect()\n//\n// The `Socket` constructor takes the mount point of the socket,\n// the authentication params, as well as options that can be found in\n// the Socket docs, such as configuring the `LongPoll` transport, and\n// heartbeat.\n//\n// ## Channels\n//\n// Channels are isolated, concurrent processes on the server that\n// subscribe to topics and broker events between the client and server.\n// To join a channel, you must provide the topic, and channel params for\n// authorization. Here's an example chat room example where `\"new_msg\"`\n// events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and\n// the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:\n//\n//     let channel = socket.channel(\"room:123\", {token: roomToken})\n//     channel.on(\"new_msg\", msg => console.log(\"Got message\", msg) )\n//     $input.onEnter( e => {\n//       channel.push(\"new_msg\", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)\n//        .receive(\"ok\", (msg) => console.log(\"created message\", msg) )\n//        .receive(\"error\", (reasons) => console.log(\"create failed\", reasons) )\n//        .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue...\") )\n//     })\n//     channel.join()\n//       .receive(\"ok\", ({messages}) => console.log(\"catching up\", messages) )\n//       .receive(\"error\", ({reason}) => console.log(\"failed join\", reason) )\n//       .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue. Still waiting...\") )\n//\n//\n// ## Joining\n//\n// Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to\n// `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.\n// Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for\n// updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.\n// Successful joins receive an \"ok\" status, while unsuccessful joins\n// receive \"error\".\n//\n// ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions\n//\n// While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,\n// the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any\n// given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,\n// the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and\n// spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their\n// `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new\n// channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.\n//\n// ## Pushing Messages\n//\n// From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server\n// can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally\n// receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use\n// `receive(\"timeout\", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks\n//  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 5000ms.\n//\n//\n// ## Socket Hooks\n//\n// Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via\n// `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:\n//\n//     socket.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error with the connection!\") )\n//     socket.onClose( () => console.log(\"the connection dropped\") )\n//\n//\n// ## Channel Hooks\n//\n// For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events\n// to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:\n//\n//     channel.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error!\") )\n//     channel.onClose( () => console.log(\"the channel has gone away gracefully\") )\n//\n// ### onError hooks\n//\n// `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel\n// crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted\n// automatically in an exponential backoff manner.\n//\n// ### onClose hooks\n//\n// `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly\n// closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling\n// `channel.leave()`\n//\n//\n// ## Presence\n//\n// The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information\n// from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.\n//\n// ### Syncing initial state from the server\n//\n// `Presence.syncState` is used to sync the list of presences on the server\n// with the client's state. An optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callback can\n// be provided to react to changes in the client's local presences across\n// disconnects and reconnects with the server.\n//\n// `Presence.syncDiff` is used to sync a diff of presence join and leave\n// events from the server, as they happen. Like `syncState`, `syncDiff`\n// accepts optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callbacks to react to a user\n// joining or leaving from a device.\n//\n// ### Listing Presences\n//\n// `Presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information\n// based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence\n// metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to\n// allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.\n// For example, you may have a user online from different devices with a\n// a metadata status of \"online\", but they have set themselves to \"away\"\n// on another device. In this case, they app may choose to use the \"away\"\n// status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`\n// function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for\n// each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device\n// they came online from:\n//\n//     let state = {}\n//     state = Presence.syncState(state, stateFromServer)\n//     let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {\n//       first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences\n//       first.id = id\n//       return first\n//     }\n//     let onlineUsers = Presence.list(state, listBy)\n//\n//\n// ### Example Usage\n//\n//     // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device\n//     let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {\n//       if(!current){\n//         console.log(\"user has entered for the first time\", newPres)\n//       } else {\n//         console.log(\"user additional presence\", newPres)\n//       }\n//     }\n//

Most chords played on the guitar consist of 3 notes but many contain 4 or more pitches.\\nChords are comprised of the **1st**, **3rd**, & **5th** notes of their corresponding scales.  For example:\\n* a C MAJOR **SCALE** contains the notes **C D E F G A B C**\\n* a C MAJOR **CHORD** contains the notes **C E G**, the **1st**, **3rd**, & **5th** notes of the C MAJOR SCALE.\\n* a G MAJOR **SCALE** contains the notes **G A B C D E F# G**\\n* a G MAJOR **CHORD** contains the notes **G B D**, the **1st**, **3rd**, & **5th** notes of the G MAJOR SCALE.\\n***\\n##### Numeric Chords (i.e. 7th, 9th, 11th, etc.)\\n**7th chords** are the same as regular chords but in addition to the standard chord pitches, they also contain the **7th** pitch of the scale.\\nSimilarly, **9th chords** add the **9th** pitch of the scale.\\n\\nFor the scope of this site, we will concentrate on the basic 6 chords:\\n* **MAJOR** _written as_ **M** ex: **CM**, or simply **C**\\n* **MINOR** _written as_ **m** ex: **Cm**\\n* **MAJOR 7TH** _written as_ **M7** ex: **CM7**\\n* **MINOR 7TH** _written as_ **m7** ex: **Cm7**\\n* **DOMINANT 7TH** _written as_ **7** ex: **C7**\\n* **DIMINISHED 7TH** _written as_ **dim7** ex: **Cdim7**\\n***\\n##### Chord Functions\\nWithin any given key, chords are defined by their function, or number, using roman numerals. Within the **C MAJOR SCALE** the **C** chord has the function **I** because it is built off the\\nfirst pitch of the scale. The **Dm** chord, has the function **ii** because it is built off the 2nd pitch of the scale.  _Note the lowercase **ii** because the chord is minor_\\nYou should begin by learning the **I**, **IV**,**V**, & **vi** chords of any given key as those are by far the most commonly played chords.\\n***\\n##### How To Learn\\n* Begin by learning the **I**, **IV**,**V**, & **vi** chords in the keys **C, G, D** & **Am**.\\n* Once those are comfortable start looking at some of the bar chords in other keys.\\n* _NOTE: In some of the \\\"easier\\\" keys, we have modified chords that would normally require bar chords to make them more accessible._\\n* Once you feel comfortable with basic chords, start looking at 7th chords.\\n* A great way to improve your mastery of chords is to memorize the \\\"shape\\\" of the chord away from the guitar.\\nIn other words, practice the shape of the chord without placing it on the fretboard.  This will accelerate your muscle memory patterning and increase your\\nability to quickly move your fingers into that chord position.\\n';\nvar _user$project$Views_Modal$chordModal = function (model)
